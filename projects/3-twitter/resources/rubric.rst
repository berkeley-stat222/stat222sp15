Statistics 222 grading rubric
=============================

For the third project you will need to present a practice talk in class on
Wednesday, March 11th and your final presentation in class on Monday, March
16th.

Your group will be responsible for preparing a Pecha Kucha style talk.  The
expectation is that your group will prepare 20 slides for your talk.  You
should divide the slides up evenly among the members of your team.  The night
before your presentation you will need to email your slides as a PDF file to
both Cari and Jarrod.  We will have a laptop connected to the projector with
your slides preloaded.  When it is your group's turn, we will call you to the
front of the room and once everyone is ready we will start playing your slide
deck.  Each slide will auto-advance after 20 seconds.  Thus it is essential
that you carefully prepare and rehearse your presentation.  If you get out of
sync with the slides, it will distract from your presentation and cause
confusion and difficulty for your teammates.  If your team has any non-static
slides (e.g., animations), you should talk with Cari as soon as possible to
confirm the file format can be displayed.

As with the last project, we are expecting you to present substantial work.
You will need to motivate your questions, explain how you manipulated your
data, and justify any conclusions you make.  This is a technical talk, so focus
on conveying information rather than trying to merely entertain.

Below is the grading rubric we will be using to assess your submissions. To
receive the equivalent of an "A" on this assignment your group will need to
have roughly two check marks and two check pluses.
